#  This project is simple to use, simply connect it to an electric line and enter the password and the current will no longer flow from the electric line once you are done working simply enter the password again and the current will start to flow again. Also, this circuit does not require any external power supply to works but it will derive its working power from the line it’s connected to so we don’t need to carry any battery with us.
