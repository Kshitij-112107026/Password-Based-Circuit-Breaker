# Password-Based-Circuit-Breaker
The major problem in the power system is the electrical accidents while
repairing the electrical lines due to the lack of communication between the
electrical substation and maintenance staff. This project gives a solution to
this problem to ensure line man safety. The current lines are to be checked
and maintained regularly and this task is not always done by an experienced
engineer but by a daily wage worker having very little knowledge of how to
operate properly on such a large current. So, the risk to life is very large,
especially in rural parts of India. To make sure that no worker should be
working risking their life we have come up with a solution of password-based
circuit breaker. This circuit is simple to use simply connect it to an electric
line and enter the password and the current will no longer flow from the
electric line once you are done working simply enter the password again and
the current will start to flow again. Also, this circuit does not require any
external power supply to woks bur it will derive its working power from the
line it’s connected to so we don’t need to carry any battery with us.
